## Development

### Scripts
- `npm start` - Start the server in production mode
- `npm run dev` - Start the server in development mode with nodemon
- `npm test` - Run tests (to be implemented)

### Adding New Features
1. Create the model in the `models/` directory
2. Create the controller in the `controllers/` directory
3. Create the routes in the `routes/` directory
4. Add validation rules in `middleware/validation.js`
5. Update the main server file to include new routes

## Deployment

### Environment Variables
Make sure to set the following environment variables in production:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your production MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - A strong secret key for JWT signing
- `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` - A strong secret key for refresh tokens
- `FRONTEND_URL` - Your frontend application URL

### Security Considerations
- Use strong, unique JWT secrets
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Set up proper CORS configuration
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Regular security updates and patches
